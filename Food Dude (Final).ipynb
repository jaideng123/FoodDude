    "# FoodDude: Nutritional Analysis of Foods\n",
    "### Team Dabberlee - Jaiden Gerig, Oron Hazi, Justin Katz, Kyle Wilson\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview and Motivation\n",
    "In this notebook, we wanted to explore the different foods on the USDA database and see if there are foods out there that can provide all the necessary nutrients needed by a basic 2000 calorie diet. That is, if a single food could possibly be able to provide all the nutrients a human needs while staying within a reasonable calorie range. \n",
    "\n",
    "Originally, one of our team members, Kyle Wilson, prepared a data science spotlight about trying to fulfill desired macronutrients for the least amount of money with fast food. We wanted to look more closely at food analysis through nutrients without regard to price. The USDA database provided us with nutrients for many groceries and fast foods, which gave us a nice base to work off of.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Related work\n",
    "Soylent advertises itself as the only food a human needs in a day. It provides “all the protein, carbohydrates, lipids, and micronutrients that a body needs to thrive.” While Soylent is engineered specifically for this purpose, we wanted to see if there is a food already out there that can provide the same benefits that Soylent can.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial Questions\n",
    "* Is there a food that, if eaten solely, could fulfill all the nutritional requirements of a 2000 calorie diet?\n",
    "* What are the foods that provide all the nutritional value you need for the fewest amount of calories?\n",
    "* What are some overall trends of the best foods?\n",
    "* What are the trends of all the foods that provide you with enough nutrients?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploratory Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the data we needed was readily available in a CSV file."
